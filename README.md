# **Reporting Suspicious Events System**

## **About the Project**
This is a final project for the **"Advanced Programming in Python"** course at Max Stern Academic College of Emek Yezreel.

The system was developed to allow reporting of unusual or suspicious events that could have a broad impact on public health, pose a danger to life, 
or present any other significant risk.

Examples of such events include:
- An outbreak of a contagious disease.
- Contamination of drinking water.
- A malfunction in an electric cable.
Any other event that endangers or might endanger the lives of others.

The system encourages users to report and verify events through a monetary reward model.

## Technologies
### Programming Language: Python.
**Database:** SQL (MySQL). The system connects to a database named db_finaleproject.
**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user interface was built to support all required functions.
**Code Structure:** The code is clearly written and divided into classes, utilizing inheritance and polymorphism.
